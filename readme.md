Initial running example from https://www.dhpoware.com/demos/glLayeredWindows.html

Example uses PBuffer and the old GL pipeline.

We'd like:
    - [ ] Multisampling to a seperate FBO
    - [ ] Resolve the multisample to a FBO.
    - [ ] Copy pixel data out of FBO instead of BPO.
    - [ ] Use a modern pipeline and get rid of glu stuff.
