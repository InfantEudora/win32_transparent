 This demo builds on the previous layered window demo.
 (http:www.dhpoware.com/downloads/LayeredWindow.zip).

 In the previous demo, we used a TGA image with an embedded alpha mask as the
 source of our layered window.

 In this demo we use OpenGL to draw a rotating cube to a pbuffer. Once the
 scene is drawn to the pbuffer we then make a local system memory copy of
 the pbuffer's pixel data and use that as the source of our layered window.

 You can move the cube around the screen by holding down the left mouse
 button and dragging. To exit the demo press the ESC key.

 This demo requires Windows 2000, XP, or higher to run. The minimum supported
 operating system for the layered windows API is Windows 2000.

 This demo also requires the following OpenGL extensions:
  WGL_ARB_pbuffer
  WGL_ARB_pixel_format
