/*
    chasm - a top-down colony sim on a Townscaper-style irregular grid. See docs/README.md for the
    game and the rules every step follows, and docs/grid_plan.md for the build order.

    STEP 1: the grid generator, a top-down camera, and the grid drawn as lines with its debug
    views and checks. STEP 2: picking - the plot, fine cell and coarse cell under the cursor,
    highlighted, and a click to select (GridPick.h).

    --- THREADS -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The grid is IMMUTABLE once built and held by shared_ptr. Regenerating builds a new one on
    whichever thread asked (the panel, an MCP handler) and swaps the pointer under grid_mutex; a
    reader takes a copy of the pointer under the same mutex and then reads freely. So nothing ever
    waits on a generation except whoever asked for it, and no reader can see half a grid.

    The camera state (camera_target and cam_*) belongs to the physics thread's UpdateView, which
    runs with physics_mutex held. The panel writes it directly (it holds that mutex too); an MCP
    handler goes through Scene::AtTickBoundary.

    --- DEBUG ONLY ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The grid's line view, its layers and the checks exist only in a debug build (docs/README.md,
    "Checks live in the app"). A release build generates the same grid and draws only the ground.
